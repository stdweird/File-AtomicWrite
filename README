Atomic file writes via rename(1) and lots of (optional) sanity checks to ensure
that things have not gone awry, for example if the new /etc/passwd is of size
0, perhaps don't copy it into place?

To install this module, use CPAN, for example:

  cpan File::AtomicWrite

The source tree is available at:

http://github.com/thrig/File-AtomicWrite/

This can be built and installed by running:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Run perldoc(1) on File::AtomicWrite for more documentation.
